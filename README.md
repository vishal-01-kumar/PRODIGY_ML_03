1. Project Title: "Image Classification of Dogs and Cats using Support Vector Machines"

2. Objective: Developed a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats with the goal of achieving high accuracy.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Imported image data using the os library.
   - Resized images to a uniform size for consistency in analysis.

4. Feature Engineering:
   - Flattened images to create feature arrays for input into the model.

5. Model Selection and Training:
   - Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification.
   - Trained the SVM model on the preprocessed image data.

6. Evaluation and Performance:
   - Achieved an accuracy of 62.25% on the test dataset.
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

7. Potential Improvements:
   - Identified opportunities for improvement such as feature extraction techniques, data augmentation, and model tuning.

8. Skills Demonstrated:
